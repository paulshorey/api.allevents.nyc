Ivan Reitman gained fame in the late 1970s and 80s for comedy classics like ANIMAL HOUSE, STRIPES, GHOSTBUSTERS, and many others. But before that he produced several horror films in his native Canada, including two that would be distributed in the U.S. by AIP: the 1973 satire CANNIBAL GIRLS (screening here in February) and this decidedly uncomical rape-revenge thriller. Brenda Vaccaro stars as a model whose questionable decision to accompany a sleazy doctor to his country home suggests an inability to look after herself ? a notion that?s soon dispelled by the survival skills she summons to fend off an attacking gang of backwoods locals, led by grindhouse axiom Don Stroud.

Though AIP bought several films from legendary British horror studio Hammer Film Productions for distribution in the U.S., THE VAMPIRE LOVERS was their only official co-production. Hammer?s fortunes were in decline at the time, its updated takes on classic characters like Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy no longer seeming quite so modern in the age of increasingly sophisticated, graphic, and/or sexually explicit horror films like ROSEMARY?S BABY, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and the work of Herschell Gordon Lewis. In this context, a partnership with AIP made perfect sense, and the result was a pioneering lesbian vampire film (these vampires go for the breast, not the neck) with the period setting and sumptuous d�cor of classic Hammer horror but the ample nudity and gore that AIP could gleefully market to the drive-ins. Loosely based on a novella by gothic Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu and set in 19th century Austria, it stars Polish-born horror icon Ingrid Pitt as an identity-shifting woman who makes a habit of destroying noble families by seducing and feasting upon their nubile young maidens, and Hammer axiom Peter Cushing as the General determined to exterminate her.

","With Ingrid Pitt, George Cole, Kate O?Mara, and Peter Cushing. ?IF YOU DARE?taste the deadly passion of the BLOOD-NYMPHS!? Though AIP bought several films from legendary British horror studio Hammer Film Productions for distribution in the U.S., THE VAMPIRE LOVERS was their only official co-production. Hammer?s fortunes were in decline at the time, its updated takes on classic characters like Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy no longer seeming quite so modern in the age of increasingly sophisticated, graphic, and/or sexually explicit horror films like ROSEMARY?S BABY, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and the work of Herschell Gordon Lewis. In this context, a partnership with AIP made perfect sense, and the result was a pioneering lesbian vampire film (these vampires go for the breast, not the neck) with the period setting and sumptuous d�cor of classic Hammer horror but the ample nudity and gore that AIP could gleefully market to the drive-ins. Loosely based on a novella by gothic Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu and set in 19th century Austria, it stars Polish-born horror icon Ingrid Pitt as an identity-shifting woman who makes a habit of destroying noble families by seducing and feasting upon their nubile young maidens, and Hammer axiom Peter Cushing as the General determined to exterminate her.

Ivan Reitman gained fame in the late 1970s and 80s for comedy classics like ANIMAL HOUSE, STRIPES, GHOSTBUSTERS, and many others. But before that he produced several horror films in his native Canada, including two that would be distributed in the U.S. by AIP: the 1973 satire CANNIBAL GIRLS (screening here in February) and this decidedly uncomical rape-revenge thriller. Brenda Vaccaro stars as a model whose questionable decision to accompany a sleazy doctor to his country home suggests an inability to look after herself ? a notion that?s soon dispelled by the survival skills she summons to fend off an attacking gang of backwoods locals, led by grindhouse axiom Don Stroud.

Film Form Workshop, which peaked in the 1970s. However, a recent book entitled THE STRUGGLE FOR FORM argues that a distinctive strain of moving image experimentation by Polish artists began as early as 1916 and continued at least until 1989 when their works began to merge into a globalized ?art world.? In concert with his review of THE STRUGGLE FOR FORM, published in the most recent issue of the Millennium Film Journal (MFJ 62), Andrzej Jachimczyk has curated this special one-program survey of Polish avant-garde cinema, beginning with a 1937 film by the Themersons and a formal experiment by Andrzej Paw?owski, followed by an example of the Moral Angst Cinema by Wojciech Wiszniewski and two films made under the auspices of the Film Form Workshop. The third part of the program contains an existential contemplation by Andrzej Klimowski and a social critique by Hieronim Neumann, and ends with a 1997 documentary by the film visionary Kazimierz Karabasz. Though Polish avant-garde cinema is often considered to embrace a rigidly formalist position, this program suggests that changes in political climate have as significant an influence as aesthetic prerogatives on the methods and ideas of moving image artists. Though none of the works can be definitively categorized, the program includes fictional, animation, and documentary approaches to film.

Vernon Zimmerman boasts a peerlessly strange filmography: his early films include two underground shorts starring the great Taylor Mead (TO L.A.

The film flaunts its uninhibited love for everything decent folk call Bad Taste: traveling salesmen jokes, tufted velvet sofas, STP decals, greaser rock, suede hot pants, vinyl boots ? and roller derbies. Zimmerman?s treatment of the derby subculture is realistic in spirit and zest ? but not in detail. UNHOLY ROLLERS is an exuberant, rococo, preposterous exaggeration of the skating lifestyle. [?] Zimmerman?s approach is that of a physician giving electroshock treatments to a cadaver. He keeps hyping the trite and familiar exploitation plot with jolts of gratuitous sex and violence, vulgar wisecracking, incongruous actions, riotous sounds and colors.

Share + This screening is part of: RE-VISIONS: AMERICAN EXPERIMENTAL FILM 1975-90 Film Notes ","LIZZIE BORDEN Born in Detroit, Michigan, Lizzie Borden is best known for her anarcha-feminist classic, BORN IN FLAMES (1983), which Melissa Anderson calls, ?A precursor to New Queer Cinema in its genre hybridization (radical-lesbian-feminist-sci-fi v�rit�) and political fury.? Borden has created a small but explosive body of work that challenges viewers to rethink their assumptions about gender, sexuality, race, and class. After majoring in art history at Wellesley College, Borden moved to NYC where she originally aspired to be a painter and wrote for Artforum Magazine. She began her filmmaking career by creating the soundtrack for Richard Serra?s documentary, STEELMILL. Borden?s first feature was REGROUPING (1976), about a women?s consciousness-raising group. The homogeneity of race and class in the group led her to embark on BORN IN FLAMES, while her interest in the sex industry and labor resulted in WORKING GIRLS (1986), an un-romanticized look at a middle-class brothel in Manhattan. Borden landed in movie jail with her studio-recut, erotic thriller LOVE CRIMES (1992), but has since directed several TV episodes, including RED SHOE DIARIES and Propaganda Film?s INSIDE OUT, starring Alexis Arquette, Joe Dallesandro, and Mary Woronov. For her RE-VISIONS program, we?re overjoyed to premiere our brand-new 35mm preservation of BORN IN FLAMES, alongside very rare screenings of her debut feature, REGROUPING, presented in collaboration with the Outfest UCLA Legacy Project. REGROUPING 1976, 80 min, 16mm, b&w. This screening is co-presented by the Outfest UCLA Legacy Project; archival print courtesy of UCLA Film & Television Archive. In this experimental film, Borden explores the dynamics among the members of a woman?s group. As she interviews people who know them, such as Joan Jonas, the group shoots ?artistic? scenes of themselves ? but Borden feels they aren?t fully grappling with issues of sexuality and politics. Are they a serious group ? or just friends? After showing an early edit of the film to the group, its members, upset, close ranks. Undeterred, Borden incorporates the group?s arguments into another edit, filming larger groups commenting both on the original one and on consciousness-raising groups in general. Uncredited voices include those of Barbara Kruger and Kathryn Bigelow. The screening on Saturday, February 20 at 4:45 will be followed by a Q&A with Lizzie Borden and film critic Amy Taubin!

Made in the wake of AIP?s enormously successful series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, MASTER OF THE WORLD is adapted from a pair of Jules Verne novels, and features the star of the Poe films, Vincent Price, alongside a young Charles Bronson (whose first leading role came a few years earlier, in AIP?s MACHINE-GUN KELLY). Price is a mid-nineteenth century millionaire whose admirable quest to eliminate war and conflict from the globe is undercut by his curious strategy for achieving peace: to use his self-constructed airship to bomb all military installations to smithereens. Eager to consolidate its newfound respectability, AIP devoted its largest budget to date to MASTER OF THE WORLD, while entrusting the project to the under-appreciated journeyman William Witney (today a favorite of Quentin Tarantino?s). The result is a strange combination of big-budget spectacle and typical AIP corner-cutting, and ultimately a fascinating film, both for its paradoxical portrait of a mad peacenik and for the bizarre clash between the disparate acting styles of Price and Bronson.

Share + This screening is part of: RE-VISIONS: AMERICAN EXPERIMENTAL FILM 1975-90 Film Notes ","LIZZIE BORDEN WILL BE HERE IN PERSON FOR A Q&A FOLLOWING THE SCREENING! LIZZIE BORDEN Born in Detroit, Michigan, Lizzie Borden is best known for her anarcha-feminist classic, BORN IN FLAMES (1983), which Melissa Anderson calls, ?A precursor to New Queer Cinema in its genre hybridization (radical-lesbian-feminist-sci-fi v�rit�) and political fury.? Borden has created a small but explosive body of work that challenges viewers to rethink their assumptions about gender, sexuality, race, and class. After majoring in art history at Wellesley College, Borden moved to NYC where she originally aspired to be a painter and wrote for Artforum Magazine. She began her filmmaking career by creating the soundtrack for Richard Serra?s documentary, STEELMILL. Borden?s first feature was REGROUPING (1976), about a women?s consciousness-raising group. The homogeneity of race and class in the group led her to embark on BORN IN FLAMES, while her interest in the sex industry and labor resulted in WORKING GIRLS (1986), an un-romanticized look at a middle-class brothel in Manhattan. Borden landed in movie jail with her studio-recut, erotic thriller LOVE CRIMES (1992), but has since directed several TV episodes, including RED SHOE DIARIES and Propaganda Film?s INSIDE OUT, starring Alexis Arquette, Joe Dallesandro, and Mary Woronov. For her RE-VISIONS program, we?re overjoyed to premiere our brand-new 35mm preservation of BORN IN FLAMES, alongside very rare screenings of her debut feature, REGROUPING, presented in collaboration with the Outfest UCLA Legacy Project. REGROUPING 1976, 80 min, 16mm, b&w. This screening is co-presented by the Outfest UCLA Legacy Project; archival print courtesy of UCLA Film & Television Archive. In this experimental film, Borden explores the dynamics among the members of a woman?s group. As she interviews people who know them, such as Joan Jonas, the group shoots ?artistic? scenes of themselves ? but Borden feels they aren?t fully grappling with issues of sexuality and politics. Are they a serious group ? or just friends? After showing an early edit of the film to the group, its members, upset, close ranks. Undeterred, Borden incorporates the group?s arguments into another edit, filming larger groups commenting both on the original one and on consciousness-raising groups in general. Uncredited voices include those of Barbara Kruger and Kathryn Bigelow.

In Polish with English subtitles. We all come from water and water courses through our bodies. We are a bubble floating down the river of life to the unknown. Water is both a source of life and a threat. When water becomes a menace to our lives and senses, our existence is truly frightened. KANAL follows a near-decimated company of Polish resistance fighters as they make a final effort to escape the encircling Nazis through the sewers of Warsaw. A merciless view of their flight through the putrid waters, KANAL is a story void of glory and nearly void of hope, where the desire for dignity, even survival, becomes faint. Wajda was an important figure for our youth in Japan. When Eiko & Koma performed in the Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology in 2007, founded by Wajda in Krakow, Poland, we had the pleasure of meeting the filmmaker and telling him how his ASHES AND DIAMONDS had had a special meaning for those of us who were student fighters in the political movements of the late ?60s. His KANAL inspired Koma and me in 1989 to create the work, CANAL, a work for several naked bodies, whose stage design suggested both urban sewers and the blood stream of a body.

Made in the wake of AIP?s enormously successful series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, MASTER OF THE WORLD is adapted from a pair of Jules Verne novels, and features the star of the Poe films, Vincent Price, alongside a young Charles Bronson (whose first leading role came a few years earlier, in AIP?s MACHINE-GUN KELLY). Price is a mid-nineteenth century millionaire whose admirable quest to eliminate war and conflict from the globe is undercut by his curious strategy for achieving peace: to use his self-constructed airship to bomb all military installations to smithereens. Eager to consolidate its newfound respectability, AIP devoted its largest budget to date to MASTER OF THE WORLD, while entrusting the project to the under-appreciated journeyman William Witney (today a favorite of Quentin Tarantino?s). The result is a strange combination of big-budget spectacle and typical AIP corner-cutting, and ultimately a fascinating film, both for its paradoxical portrait of a mad peacenik and for the bizarre clash between the disparate acting styles of Price and Bronson.

He keeps hyping the trite and familiar exploitation plot with jolts of gratuitous sex and violence, vulgar wisecracking, incongruous actions, riotous sounds and colors. And in the end Zimmerman?s shock treatments are much more exciting than the forgettable story line, and, in fact, give the film a unique personality.

This early film by Joseph Ruben, who would go on to direct 1980s classic THE STEPFATHER, is a gripping story of two young couples who head out to Alaska looking for adventure but instead find themselves slipping into a life of crime. A mixture of road movie, crime film, and working class drama, with an Electric Light Orchestra-dominated soundtrack, JOYRIDE is a typically (for the 1970s) textured and human-scaled film with a palpable sense of place (albeit with the Pacific Northwest standing in for Alaska). It?s also distinguished by its stunt casting, with all four protagonists played by second-generation Hollywood royalty. Film critic Peter Rainer, who co-wrote the screenplay for JOYRIDE, will be here in person for the first screening, on Sunday, February 21! PLEASE NOTE: Though we indicated in the printed calendar that JOYRIDE would be screening on 35mm, it is in fact on 16mm. The print is also significantly (though not entirely) faded.

","With Vincent Price, Charles Bronson, and Henry Hull. ?ROBUR THE CONQUEROR AND HIS AMAZING FLYING WARSHIP?DESTROYER OF THE ARMIES AND THE NAVIES OF THE WORLD?THE FABULOUS ADVENTURES OF THE MAN WHO CONQUERED THE EARTH TO SAVE IT!? Made in the wake of AIP?s enormously successful series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, MASTER OF THE WORLD is adapted from a pair of Jules Verne novels, and features the star of the Poe films, Vincent Price, alongside a young Charles Bronson (whose first leading role came a few years earlier, in AIP?s MACHINE-GUN KELLY). Price is a mid-nineteenth century millionaire whose admirable quest to eliminate war and conflict from the globe is undercut by his curious strategy for achieving peace: to use his self-constructed airship to bomb all military installations to smithereens. Eager to consolidate its newfound respectability, AIP devoted its largest budget to date to MASTER OF THE WORLD, while entrusting the project to the under-appreciated journeyman William Witney (today a favorite of Quentin Tarantino?s). The result is a strange combination of big-budget spectacle and typical AIP corner-cutting, and ultimately a fascinating film, both for its paradoxical portrait of a mad peacenik and for the bizarre clash between the disparate acting styles of Price and Bronson. PLEASE NOTE: After receiving an incomplete print and screening MASTER OF THE WORLD on DVD on Feb 20, we were able to find an alternate (in fact, an excellent) print, and will be screening it on 35mm on Thurs, Feb 25 and Sun, Feb 28!
